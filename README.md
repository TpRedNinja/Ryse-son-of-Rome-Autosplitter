Autosplitter

Made a autosplitter for this game, you dont need to install the file from here and i wont keep this up to date but just in case future versions break u can use this

How to add it to livesplit

    Download the file
    Open livesplit
    edit layout
    add scriptable autosplitter
    choose the path to the file
    then done click the start box if u want it to autostart or not, click the split if you dont want it to autosplit or if u do. If the box next to it is blue then its active if its grey then it wont do said thing.
Features

Autosplits on the next levels cutscene, autostarts after clicking yes after starting a new campaign or if you start a level. Final split should split where timer is suppose to end maybe a second early but mods can retime. Only works on steam/only tested on steam may work on other store front versions idk and no i wont buy it on other store fronts sorry unless u want to gift it to me then sure.
